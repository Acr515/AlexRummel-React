# React Template

## What is this?

This template was created by Alex Rummel and includes all the boilerplate code necessary to quickly begin creating a React project.

## Usage

First duplicate this folder, initialize a git repository, and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

From there, you can run or build the app using `npm start` or `npm build`. The webpack configuration defaults to hosting to the port 8000, which can be adjusted in the configuration file. Builds will emit into the /dist directory. You should also adjust any naming or version settings in package.json and package-lock.json.

## Features

This React project contains the bare minimum to get started:

- Webpack, React.js, and Babel for building and testing
- ESLint, which incldues a plugin to force imports to use single quotes
- Sass file support
